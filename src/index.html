        <p>Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 in Tokyo by the three men, Isao Takahata, Toshio Suzuki and the well-known 
          film producer Hayao Miyazaki. The name Studio Ghibli was based on the Arabic name for "hot sahara wind" because
           the founders wanted Studio Ghibli to blow new wind through the anime industry.</p>
